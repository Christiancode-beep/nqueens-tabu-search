**A Python implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using:**

Tabu Search (metaheuristic optimization)

Backtracking (exact method)

with real-time visualization and performance comparison.

**Features**
✔ Two Algorithms

Tabu Search: Fast, scalable for large N (up to 50+ queens)

Backtracking: Guaranteed solution (for N ≤ 12)

**✔ Real-Time Visualization**

Live chessboard updates

Color-coded queens (red = under attack, gold = safe)

**✔ Performance Metrics**

Execution time

Iteration count

Success/failure status

**✔ User-Friendly CLI**

Interactive input

Automatic comparison
